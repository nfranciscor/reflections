How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?



You can compare both docs and see what ha changed from the working one.



How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?



You will have all the changes that you have made available, so you can checked some things
that you have done in the past that failed or passed.



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros > you can have everychanges saved in cause you run out of energy, for example.
    cons> you may be saving things that you shouldnt be saving or that you dont want to.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Because GIT treats your whole project as an unique entity, while in Google docs,
for example, each doc is an entity different from the others docs that you may have.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log to see all the commits that have been done to the project and git diff to see all the differences between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

A lot more, because if something breaks, I just need to go back to the previous version that I have saved.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

To work with a local repository and then saving the changes to a new one on the internet.
